            <p className="p-2 pt-[11rem] md:pt-[5rem] lg:pt-[7rem]">Im Thomas Mathew, 30, have a diploma in VFX.

            Now I know I&apos;ve said I love coding. Im self-taught. But that dosen&apos;t mean I would 
            enjoy being glued to a 2D screen 24x7 - which I&apos;ve been doing 
            for this whole past year only to get to this point!<br/><br/>

               Let me ask you something. Would you be okay with having
            the most luscious, most mouth-watering dishes served to you
            on a daily basis BUT on a 2D screen? <br/><br/>

            Exactly. Everything&apos;s better in 3D whether people are aware/accepting of it or not.

   
            For me its about messing around and having fun with the website building process while
            at the same time staying in that constant state of awareness that I&apos;m just staring at a 2D screen
            and so I need to allocate enough time on a daily basis to step outside and see all those new sights
            and breathe all that fresh air. 


               To explore the outside world, see new places, take long walks.<br/><br/>

            I view money as &quot;freedom&quot; rather than a gadget, accessory etc. collecting responsibility 
            enhancing machine.

            People tell me I&apos;m oversmart, overconfident etc etc. I just tell them I&apos;m just less insecure.

            So to sum it up. An eccentric by all means.</p>
